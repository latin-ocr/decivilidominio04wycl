love3 St. Paul teaches us to know its qualities⁷ and by that we can see
if a ruler answers to its conditions.

The second part discusses the relations between divine and worldly
law. The former fully suffices for the government of the world, therefore
beside it neither civil nor canon law is needed.

The third part treats of political questions. Kingship is necessary
for the carrying out of the laws, for keeping the state in order, and for
defending it against rebels. The king must govern in accordance with
God's law, must reward the promoters of that law, punish enemies and
preserve peace for the country. To that end he must know God's law,
i, e, the Bible. It would be best were the world governed only by that
law; worse is the government of kingS, worst that of priests, who
prefer their hypocritical traditions to God's law. The question as to
whether one may obey a bad prince, has already been answered by
Christ. By this we may see how improperly and avariciously our
priests resist our secular princes, when the latter demand subsidies and
tenths for the protection of the realms. There is no doubt but that
it is their duty to contribute towards the defence of their country, and
as they are called on to bear the other burdens less than others, they
must in the first instance give of their worldly goods. From the pre-
ceding it is clear that Wyclif adopted ideas which had been brought
sorward in the parliamentary proceedings. The priest must not trouble
about earthly goodS. “We must not,” says Wyclif, “murmur against
the laymen when they exercise their political rights.” After having
spoken about hereditary and elective monarchy, he draws his conclu-
sions in the fourth part. For the greater part they are concerned with the
secularization of English church-propex‘ty. Since without doubt in
parliament great stress had been laid on the Church’s always retaining
the property which had been given her, Wyclif teaches that there is
no giving for all time; all the privileges connected with this matter are
voidq The question of the confiscation of church-property is discussed
at length, and in several places the connection with utterances made in
parliament becomes clear. If the clergy misuse their property, it is the
duty of the laity to take it away from them. If the possession of
earthly goods hinders them in the performance of their duties, they must
be taken away. The decision as to whether or not that is the case with
the Church must be made by the politicians, who must have the welfare
