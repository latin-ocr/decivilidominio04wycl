It must be auknowledged that up lto this 111116 1101111111· in England

The Manusoripts.

’1116 first and second books of De cix-ili Dominio are 10 be found
in (ῗο(1. 1341 of the Vienna Court Library. As Reginald Lane Poole
gives an exact description of this MS. there is 110 need to say more
about 11 here. Ι did not cop)⁷ the text of the second book myself, hut
used llerzberg Frankel‘s copy, which was placed 31 111)- disposal by the
Wyclif Society, But last October I had an opportunity of looking at
11115 MS. and that of the third book. The Text of the second book
begins 31 folio 153 codex 1341. The most important observation seems
to me 10 be that the arrangement. of 1116 tract is the same as in codex 1294.
(See 136 Ecclesia, Intro‹.h1ction xviij» So the copy may he by the
copyists of this MS, that is Nicolaus Faulfiss aml Georg von Knyehnicz
in England in 1116 year 1407, or as appears inore probable to us, as
the writing to all appearance is a different 0116, 11 was copied from a
copy made by these two. And so MS. 1341 has the same character. In
all are found similar brief epitomes 111 1116 margin. with signs to show to
111131 11116 111 1116 text 111617 refer.

Our supposition‚ if corre‹·t, name-ly that Ι36 Civili Dominio belongs
to those works which were copied by Faulfiss and Knyehnicz, two young
students, would explain the flagrant mistakes occurring in the MS. It

difficulties, 35 1116 learned terniinology found in Vv'yclif caused them
trouble enough. We have no means of estimating the degree in which
their difficulties were increased, when they set to work now at Ox-
ford, now 31 Κ611161·1011 near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire (see De
