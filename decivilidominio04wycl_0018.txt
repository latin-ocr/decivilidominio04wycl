sword, a plain reference to Gregory XI,7 whose war against the Floren-
tines was raging most violently.

But just that war against Florence brought the pope into financial
difficulties, and necessitated his making the English clei-gy contribute

unmet sor more than two years.¹ Nobody holding a benefice in England
is exempt from payment, with the exception of the cardinals. And just at
this moment, when the distress ol the Curia (then one said “the Church'U

appear again emphatically enough now also in the third book De
Civili Dominio. We must here confine ourselves to these general remarks
on the contents of this book, for details referring to the work itself.r We
will only make some important remarks.

Anybody who has read the extremely passionate attacks which Wyclif
made at a later time on the begging orders ('‘those sects’‘ is his standing ex-
pression, showing his utter contempt) will in the highest degree be astonished
at the good things he says os them in most of the sections of this book.
But that is intelligible enough. When he began this part there had not
