lNTRODUCTION. XXI

supplied from the sense, yet in others, and numerous ones, it was difficult
enough, as besides the completions proposed others were possible. It
was still more difficult where obviously several words have been omitted
and where whole sentences are wanting, although some such corrupt
passages could be emended by comparing them with analogous passages
in other books of Wyclif’s; yet others again could be emended according
to the sense, but even then there remained a considerable number of
passages in which every attempt at emendation or interpretation according
to the sense proved quite hopeless.1 Small apparent mistakes were
simply corrected, but in difficult passages the corrections were not
always incorporated with the text; incorporation took place only when
the correction was considered quite certain, Ι have thought it necessary
here to refer to these things, so that the reader of the book may not
accuse the editor of having passed them by heedlessly.‘2 When it has
been possible to restore at least a number of the corrupt passages, Ι
owe it to the proved zeal and faithful cooperation of F. D. Matthew, to
whom the editor and the reader of the text owe their warmest thankS.
Likewise such thanks are here given to R. L. Poole‚ who assisted the

editor with many an emendation of the text, and who made the marginal

notes to part of the second book.3

fores emoritur et declinante instead of nudus ante fores earum Christus emoritur . . . .
HI, p. 58, 59 there is a long passage from Bernard5 p. 50 sit itaque instead of
nasciturus itaque . . . . eligere cuius instead of eligere tempus . . . . declinandum
instead of reclinandum . nullam avaro instead of nullam audio .. . . Prius
Adam instead of Primus autem Adam . . . . Ama laudet instead of Ama nesciri,
laudet . . .’. ergo plane ut instead of ergo stabulum elegit? Plane ut . . . . Even in
passages from the ssible, which it would have been easy to collate, there are flagrant
mistakes and omissions² e. g. p. 35 are wanting the words: qui in manifesto iudeus
est ne.

1 This is done by the words: Hie locus corruptus est or llic locus corruptus
esse videtur . . . . oder Hic aliquot verba exciderunt.

’ 2 Stress must be laid on some of Wyclif's Latin sermons that in part
contain the same thoughts, which serves to fix their date. (Wyclif’s Latin SermonS.
Edited by J. Loserth 111, 184, 239, 248, 347, 369, 390, 441 and 471.)

3 Unfortunately the appendix promised on p. 1 of the second book⁷ which
would have given an explanation of “Socius de ordine Sti Benedicti'’, was never
made, and so the passage remains as dark as before.
