XX INTRODUCTION.

Forma religionis in habitu.

These notes run throughout the whole volume. Regrettable as it
is that they are wanting, the time required for collating the Manuscript
anew and copying the notes would be out of proportion to the result.
The collation of page 377 of the text with the MS. happily showed that
at least the text. has been well copied; and so most of the mistakes it
contains are to be put down to the account of the old copyists. The
text ends on folio 260d.

The many mistakes in the MSS. 1340 and 1341 make the editor⁷s
task a very difficult one. There are passages in the text now which are
thoroughly corrupt, be it that the copyists miscopied single words of
the text they had before them,l or omitted worcls‚2 or portioris of

sentences, nay whole sentences.

There is not a page of the MS. on which there are not one or
more such mistakeS. We learn to understand their nature by comparing
the text with quotations from the Corpus Juris canonici‚3 the fathers of
the church,4 the Bible &c¹ In some places the missing words might easily be

1 111, p. 3, 1. 1 varia instead of vana; p. 4, l. 12 tercium instead of t'orcium3
p. 6, l. 27 suo instead of sua3 p. 7, l. 38 quo instead of quod; p. 8, 1. 29 ego
instead of ergo3 p. 11, l. 4 caritatem instead of caritative, l. 8 percuciuntur instead
of parciuntur etc. . . . In numerous places the word Assumptum has been misread
as either argumentum or assertum.

2 Single words are wanting: p. ι, l. 27 prior3 p. 5, 1. 31 De; p. 7, l. 31
Domini3 p. 8, 1. 30 after parvitate a word is wanting3 p. 15, 1. 11 is wanting pre etc.
Several words are wanting p. 23, 1. 203 p. 25, 1. 2.

3 Here we will refer only to a few such cases: 111, p. 11511e quotes Decretale
Exiit qui seminat; there it reads: rem sic declaratum que instead ofrem, sitque declaratum

. . . abstractionibus instead of obtrectationibus . . . . depravat instead of damnaverit

. . . dicimus que instead of dicimus quod . . . . quamquam instead of quamque . . . .
inolentas instead of volentes . . . . ac vite ipsorum alutos instead of ac vita exempla
in eos facti cum ultimo non potest carere vita mortalium instead of facto et ultimo
tamquam necessario, licet primis carere possit vita mortalium . . . . Verum condentes
instead of verum condecens . . . . Sponte dicit instead of sponte devovit . . . . This
one example suffices to give an idea of the corruptness of the text. How difficult
would be the emendation of the text if we had not the Decretale at hand.

4 111, p. 96 there is a long quotation from Hieronymus. There we read
redempcio veri instead of redempcio anime viri; mone non diviciis instead of
mammone id est diviciis; erogare cepero instead of egrotare cepero3 Christus aut
