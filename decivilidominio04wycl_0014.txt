Χ INTRODUCTION.

property, the real tendency is quite apparent. In this sense he says: Π
the possessions of the Church were in the hands of laymen, how differ—
ently they could bc'divided. It would be best for the state to provide
every clergyman with food and clothing. If there is no government
which is established sor all time, ecclesiastical foundations cannot be made
for eternity: confiscation is the fate which will one day overtake the
estates of the proud abbeys. What wonder is it that the church
authorities resisted theses which threatened their possessfflnsg and that is
the reason why suddenly the hierarchy began to oppose the professor,
who till then had been little enough regarded.

In London such doctrines soon gained ground everywhere3
inembers of the aristocracy joined Wyelif3 the people liked to hear him
speakz and in many London churches he appeared as a celebrated
preacher. Hut the most annoying thing, as VValsinghain tells us, was that
Wyclif proclaimed his theses briefly and bluntly‚ as he had written them,
without in anywise limiting them. All London was full of his fame. But
for a long time the bishops would not hear, and the archbishop lay
“in a deep sleep’‘.

The first that rose against the bold man were members of the
possessing orders of monks, for whom Wyelif’s theories could not but
some day become dangerous. They found allies also among other orders;
Oxford monks began the conflict7 and introduced into the polemics that
rude tone of which Wyclif complained.¹ Then the bishops woke up. They
would have liked to confine the dispute to their own ground. They
summoned Wyciif to appear at St. Paul's on February loth, it was a
Thursday. He appeared after Nones, i. e. after 12 o'clock,‘-'

The issue of the affair is well known, XVyclifian tendencies are
recognisable in the threatening words which Lancaster addressed to
Courtenay‚ Bishop ol* London. He would, he said, bend the English
clergy, even were its members descended from the noblest families.

2 Lechler thinks that the sitting took place before 9 o'clock. But I do not
understand how hc reconciles that with the fact that before the proceedings at
St. Paul’s on that same day a sitting of parliament which Lam-aster attendcd had
taken place. Lechler did not see that the horae by which the chroniclcr reckoncd are
horae canonicae, so that the Nona is at 12 o’clock. which makes everything fit in: in
the morning sitting of parliament‚ in the at'ternoon meeting at St. Paul’s.
