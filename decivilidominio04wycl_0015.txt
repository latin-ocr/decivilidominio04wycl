INTRODUCTION. XI

Lancaster spread out his hand to protect Wyclif. But then the blows
rained down on Wyclif, and to defend himself he wrote the second and
third books of De Civili Dominio. The consequence is that, unlike the
first book, the second already has a polemical character, although the
polemic always remains moderate. Now he teaches that the secular
rule of the clergy should be abolished, of whatever sort it might be,
that ‘church-property must be sequestrated or entirely confiscated and
redistributed. Naturally doctrines which gave the temporal powers the
right to take to themselves again the property which their ancestors
had given to the Church made the worst impression on the rich orders.
A Benedictine monk at Oxford, or perhaps one affiliated to the Bene-
dictines‚¹ for it seems it was a mendicant friar, William Wadford,
accused Wyclif of blasphemy, scandaL haughtiness and heterodoxy.2 In
order to defend himself Wyclif was compelled to follow up the first
volume of his work on civil government with a second. We should
hardly have had the latter but for that circumstance, as the subject
was pretty well exhausted. He resumes at the sixth os the theses con-
demned by Gregory XI, of which he had treated in the 35t¹² chapter of
his first book: that the secular rulers are justified in taking away from
the Church her worldly goods, if she go astray. There have been exampleS.
How was it with the Templars? As it could happen to one* order it
could be applied to all. If the clergy have strayed from the right path
and the Church’s arm fail, the secular arm must interfere. From casual
remarks made by Wyclif, we learn that he openly advised secularization,
The clergy were tied in the bonds of the world, and spiritual only
in name· “O how happy‚”3 exclaims Wyclif, “would our country be,
and how productive if every parish there had, as formerly, its rector,

3 O quam sanctum et fertile foret regnum Anglie, si (ut olim) quelibet par-
rochialis ecclesia haberet unum sanctum rectorem cum sua familia residentem, quod-
libet regni dominium haberet unum iustum dominum cum uxore et liberis cum
proporcionali familia residentem: tunc enim non sterilescerent in Anglia tot terre
arabiles nec rarescerent ex defectu yconomie tante caristie artificialium pecorum
terre nascencium, sed regnum habundaret omui genere huiusmodi bonorum, adessent-

que servi atque artifices labori debito per civiles dominos mancipati. Nunc vero
