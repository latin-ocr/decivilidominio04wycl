XII INTRODUCTION.

if every estate in the land had a just owner living there with his family3
then there would not be so much arable land lying fallow‚ there would
be no lack of corn and cattle, and there would be plenty of servants,
farm labourers and artizans. But now there are only tenants bearing the
rule of the clergy hardly; they care not for the tillage of the ground,
as it is not theirs3 they live by theft, as there is nobody to look after
them, and in their wantonness they disturb the kingdom.l The clergy⁷
overburdened with worldly goods, seek to equal the splendour of the
laity7 or to surpass it. How different would all that be were those
temporalities in the possession of poor owners: more homes would be
founded, the population‚ and with it the state, would grow, but the priests
could devote themselves to an edifying life, as becomes them. They would
not need to sear that aster the death of one master the next would be
ill affected towards them. They could live well on alms.''

These are Wyelif’s theori'es concerning the utilization of English
church-property. Against such views there arose adversaries on all sides.
Even people who otherwise favoured him could not but mock at him,
others again scolded him violeiitly, calling him a book from hell?-

But they did not reply with any sound arguments, as the accu-
mulating of land in mortmain and its attendant evils were too apparent.

Wyclif’s next attacks were directed against the principle of the
matter. By means of quotations from the Bible‚ Roman, English and canon
law, from the history of former kings of England, especially William Ι.
and IL, he proves that the kingdom would be justified in that course.
There are certain definite cases in which even the church plate may be
seized3 sor example in order to ransom prisoners from captivity. In
Higden, whom Wyclif quotes as a source in his historical comments‚
can be read what the monasteries gave up to obtain King Richard's
deliverance: wool, prelate's rings, church plate, crosses⁷ cups3 even the
gold was scraped off the shrines and melted down.3
