INTRODUCTION. XVII

Edward Ι. already set a limit to it.l Unfortunately his law was not fully
carried out. If it once happen that the king's alms are used for other
purposes, nobody in England will need to seek for deeisions at Rome.
Have not we the Lord God, whose authority is greater! In order that
this may be done in a disereet manner, and that the ehureh-property
be disposed 01 111 3 proper manner, let a synod be assembled. Then it
will be deereed that unworthy elergymen shall not have a right to
so great incomes to the hurt of the English people. All must rise up
against 1116 present conditions in 1116 Chureh. The (1061015 1111151 5113111
111611 words like a bow, 1116 56611131 rulers must streteh out 111611 11311(1
10 banish these evils. From 1116 proceeds of 1116 confiscated estates 161
111616 116 given 10 1116 clergy a bare sufficieney, let part be given 10 1116
poor, and let ehurehes and houses 101· 1116 worship 01 God be established.
What further should be done with the confiscated estates Wyclif 1111611)Γ
lays down.

By 110 11163115 any such foundations 35 111056 01 which England already
has 100 many should be made in future. Let nobody believe that even
the greatest number of masses 101 1116 dead, those read for the repose
01 3 potentate⁷ help themg more 15 (10116 by the prayers 01 1116 poor. It is
better 101 1116 651316 01 3 deceased person 10 be dividecl among the poor
“like drops 01 1·3111”. Even a man like Bede in one 01 1115 1611615 called
the gifts made 10 1116 Chureh by English kings foolish. Having such
01116131 111161665501·5 only brings us into danger, for they make the rich
haughty by inspiring them with too great eonfidenee in the power of
these prayers. 'l‘hese prayers have 1-31116 only when the suppliant 15 3
worthy ’(115611116 01 Christ. Gifts to the Chureh tie up property in mort-
main3 instead 01 leaving it 10 1116 11001 they increase the number 01
111056 useless alms—bearers who bring the state into confusion. Let every
man so live as 1101 10 need these mediators‚ sinee Christ 15 1115 mediator.
With this appeal ends the 11361 on civil government‚ rich in words as
in thoughts.2
