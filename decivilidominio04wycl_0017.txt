INTRODUCTION. XIII

And, adds Wyclif, Ι do not know that that was wrong. Money may
be taken away from the clergy also is they accumulate it in an avaricious
manner, but let the poor⁷ for whom the money was intended, hunger.
Nor must such property intended sor 'the poor be used for costly
buildings.¹ For what purpose does the Church want these riches? If she
could get on in poverty in the days of Sylvester and Constantine she can
do so now. No emperor had a right to make the church rich. When
the church was endowed it was done in order at the same time to render
service to the state. How is that to be reconciled with the present
misuse of those endowments? Even if one were to say, not all monks
are bad: the just are punished with the unjust‚ if they belong to the
same genus. Just as the king, and every other secular (lignitary‚ loses
his office if he fall into sin, remaining king only in name, so also the
Pope. At the moment when he wrote that — 1377 — Wyclif was still
far from condemning the papacy in principle32 that is a later phase
beginning only in the eighties; but as in the first book, now also in the
oth chapter of the second book, he emphatically states that under some
circumstances it is allowed to punish even the pope, and so why should
not the sinful clergy be subject to the secular courts? The fact that the
pope crowns emperors must not lead him to the conclusion that he
stands higher than a monarch3 certainly he would do so were he after
the coronation to wash the emperor's feet. It is evident that emperors
have the right to punish and depose popes. He who asserts that the
pope may not be punished is a wicked man, attributing to the pope
infallibility like to God.

InvEngland there exists the right to punish the elergy under certain
circumstances, and that right is not in opposition to the Bible.

Christ <lid not wish to found a temporal government, either for
himself or his apostlesg therefore it is not allowed to contend sor earthly
things such as temporals. Strife is in contradiction to the Christian law
of loving one's neighbour, and least of all may the pope seize the

the cloisters by the Hussites.
