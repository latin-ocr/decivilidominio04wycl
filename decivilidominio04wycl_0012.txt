of the state at heart. “L” continues Wychf, “pronounce these truths
only comlitio11ally, and represent them as possible, but leave the testing
of the question to the secular rulers'‘, God approvcs of the possession os
earthly goods only when they serve to make people obey 1115 law, But
if the opposite take place, God's approval is wanting, and accordingly
also the right to the possession. There is no doubt about that,
for the unrightcous possess unlawfully what they do possess. Therefore,
on pain of everlasting damnaston, the king is bound to take away from
the clergy their temporal possessions, owning which they have become
hardened in vice. If he do not do it, he is a traitor to God, he works for
Satan, and is the enemy of his own kingdom. If it be said that the king
who so acts would be excommunicated because he is working at the
destruction of the Church, sor which so many holy martyrs have shed their
blood, we must reply: Only that man can be excommunicated who loses
God's grace. Excommunication is *a word that Scripture does not know.
On account of earthly goods nobody must be excommunicated. Nobody is
made a martyr by the deprivation of temporalities3 but on the other hand
their confiscation is an excellent means sor damping the unbridled rage
of the priests. “We‚'' says Wyclif‚ ”must live in humility and poverty,
and give to the poor all that is over from church—propcrty and such as
is set aside for the relies of the poor'’. We see it is the question of
the secularization of church-property‚ which is here (liscussed at length.

There arises the question: When did Wyclif spread such teachings?
Scarcely had the Good Parliament been dismissed, when john of Gaunt
regained the old influence, of which it had deprived him. The new
parliament —- which assembled on January 27th 1377 -— was completely
under his influence3 the former resolutions were formally revoked; those
persons whom the Good Parliament had removed from their offices were
restored to them. The situation of the clergy exposed to the new
tzixation was by no means a fortunate one: but it became desperate
when Wyclif⁷s blows rained down upon them. At this time it is that he
first comes forward more boldly,1 and it is he who in the struggle with
Wykeham lends his pen to the Duke of Lancaster. Now he is no longer
satisfied with his quiet study and his university chair from which to
