INTRODUCTION. XIX

copyists themselves say that they had to contend with great difficulties.
On folio 119 d of codex 1294 we read: Correctus graviter anno domini
1407 in vigilia Purificationis sancte Marie Oxonii per Nicolaum Faulfiss
et Georgium de KnyehniCZ.

Not only the contents presented difficulties for the students‚ but
perhaps also the external form, difficulties not easily overcome‚ but it is
plain that they were in too great a hurry to correct the text properly,
evidently desiring to take as much as possible of Wyclif's writing home
with them.

If the students⁷ copy was copied again in Bohemia, there would
be more mistakes in the latter than there were already in the former.
It is much to be regretted that no Manuscripts of De Civili Dominio
have been preserved in England, as they would have enabled us to
obtain a more correct printed text than is now possible. Worst of
all is the condition of the MS, of the third book, that, as already
mentioned, is in Codex 1341 of the Vienna Court Library, and concerning
which a few words may here be said. Codex 1340 (from line 106)
contains De Civili Dominio fol. 1—2662. At the top to the bottom
there are brief marginal notes of the contents. Incipit: Ut supradicta de
lege Christi in genere plus lucescant.

The writing is from the XV. century, from the first decades of it.
In many places the text is written on scratched parchment, and therefore
less legible. During my stay in Vienna I took the opportunity myself to
have a look at the codex. It then came to me as an unpleasant surprise
that in the copy placed at the disposal of the Wyclit Society's editor
there are wanting those numerous notes which are to be found in the
margins of the text.

It is true that these marginal notes are not by Wyclif himself, but
possibly they are by some person connected with him, and therefore
not to be overlooked; on the other hand in many cases they serve as
a means of correctly understanding passages in the text, which were
obscure expressed‚ or are corrupt. Here just one sample of these
omissions. Page 1 line7 of the above mentioned text reads: Omnis
lex bona est Christi lex, omnis ordo bonus est Christi ordo. Then in the
first two columns there are also the following notes:

Christus est prior.. . Ordo quid sit et quomodo Christus continet
iu se ordinem , . , Christus prior Jesus‚ non tempore sed dignitate . . .

Bi!-
