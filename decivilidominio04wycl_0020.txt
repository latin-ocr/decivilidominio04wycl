XVI INTRODUCTION.

Of the mendicant friars he likes the Minorites hest, but he says also a
secular priest could attain to their excellencies

In the further course of his remarks he speaks of the mutual
relations between the secular and the ecclesiastical power. ln respect to
ecclesiastical matters the pope is aliove the emperor, in reference to
secular ones the emperor is higher. The former has to let all secular
power alone, the latter has to help him in all worldly matters. The
popes must obey the kings in all secular affairs, must pay taxes etc. 111
cases of excommunication one must in the last instance obtain 1116 advice
of the gospel. Should, for example, the pope excommunicate the English
and pronounce an interdict upon their country, because they would not
supply him with any financial help, England would have no reason to
sear those measures. There must 116 good reason sor excommunication—
say disobedience to the gospel.

If it be said that the Church has a right also to temporal power,
for she has taught that right and exercises 11, 11 15 311 error, And then,
what church is spoken of? Of the universal Church the Roman one is
only a part as much as the English 0116 is. Never mind though popes
and cardinals do speak in that way. Is it 111611 certain that they them-
selves are even Christians? Have they not perhaps been reprobates from
eternity (praesciti)? Here already we find the fundamental dogma of
Wyclif's theology: The Church is the totality of those destined to be
saved, the elect. To-day it is said: the monks have a right 10 secular
government! “A monk's face‚’' according to St. Peter, “should 116 bathed
in 16315, 116 15 10 speak in sighs, his fare is to be scanty, his sleep
511011, 1115 prayers -long, his walk moral, his demeanour humble”. Are
those the marks of a man exercising civil power? It would be besl to
confiscate the estates belonging to tlze convents. The civil authorities should
not omit to lay hands on thern. But then no more prayers would be
offered up for the founders of the convents. And is it, asks Wyclif, so
sure that those prayers always avail? Do not trouble about the pope’s
permission. In all England it is known that in the acquisition of
earthly goods the monks have gone beyond the rightl measure, therefore
