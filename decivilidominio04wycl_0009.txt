INTRODUCTION.

On the Contents os the De Civili Dominio.

Among Wyclif’s numerous works, even among those which taken
together make up his Summa Theologiae‚ a prominent place is occupied
by his De Civili Dominio, a tract in three books. This is less owing to its
contents‚ for in intrinsic worth it is surpassed by other books, less on
account of its form, which is rather awkward, than because it has already
crossed that line at which Wyclif's opposition to the then existing
ecclesiastical government ceases to -be of importance only for his some-
what small country and begins to assume an importance affecting the
entire Occidental Church. Almo-st twenty years ago Reginald Lane Poole
in the prefacel to his edition of the first book treated of its contents.
Six years ago Ι myself discussed the genesis of the whole tract and its
importance in the development of Wyclif’s reforming activity32 and now
I shall take the liberty to give an epitome of the remarks Ι then made,
which in English circles have become little known.

Wyclif's book De Civili Dominio in its origin is most closely
connected with the great agitation of men's minds which was brought about
by the proceedings of the Good Parliament (1376), and which gave a new
direction to Wyclif's life and work. Had he, in his teachings and wriffings,
kept to the same course as he did in the first two books of his Summa
Theologiae, the book De Mandatis Divinis and De Statu Innocenffiae, it
is hardly likely the hierarchy would ever have found occasion to proceed
against him. To whatever page we may turn we shall vainly seek
