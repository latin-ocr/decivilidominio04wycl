VI INTRODUCTION.

for any reforming’ thoughts, But from the time of the Good Parliament
he began from his ehair at the univers-{ty to defend those principles
which had been advocated‚ and doubtless also attached, in the debates
of that parliament, and he gave utterance to them in his books. In
them are precipitated those ideas by which the Good Parliament was
governed, theses and dogmas denying the Church all temporal rule.
Many of the theses seem actually to have been taken from the well
known Long Bill of the Good parliament, for example, when he
complains of the oppression of the English Church by the Curia, of the
provisions, exemptions, demands for money and the frivolous appeals —
formerly unusual — 01· of the conferi-ing of English bishoprics on
ineapable persons, who would not perform their pastoral duties. The De
Civili Dominio, like the proeeedings in the Good Parliament‚ made a
great 56115311011, despite the heavy style 111 which it is written, for the
Reformer is still burdened with his whole heavy scholastie armour, and
that makes the book hard to read. In the second and third books
besides he returns to his former arguments, and so there is 110 lack of
the repetition of one and the same thing.

The first book consists of four 611161 parts, In the first he supports
the thesis that no man that is in 3 state of sin should hold office, or
have dominion, It is a mistake to put tempora] 11116 11110 1116 hands of
the unjust. Neitlier a witness's evidence nor a judge's judgment‚ neither
material possession nor 11111611131166, exchange nor (1011311011 gives the
unjust any right to rule. No man 6311 gire another anything without
God's will—he 6311 only impart what God gives, He gives only to those
in a state of grace. Only to the just does dominion belong. But how is
it then with the rule of the priests? Generally it is said: He has given
them rule over others. Yet the priest must be not the master, but the
servant of his floek. He is commissioned not to rule, but to teach and
to preach. He cannot at one and the same time be master and servant.
Temporal authority he cannot have, spiritual belongs to every Christian3
in this way every Christian is a priest and king. There are secular
rulers appointed for corporal governinent‚ and therefore Gregory the
Great called himself not holiest father, but servant of God‘s servants
thus pronouncing words that suited his office. In spiritual government he

most despises worldly goods. All government must rest on the basis of
