INTRODUCTION. XV

the pope can simply deprive a priest of his benefice, without so much
as even raising the question of his capacity or incapacity7 he may like-
wise restore their (lomains to the laity.¹ If here Wyclif is referring to
an incident in his own life, as he seems to be, namely that in the
church at Lincoln the pope deprived him of a benefice and conferred
it on a young foreigner (alienigena ydiota),2 yet it does not diminish
the respect he has for the head of the Church. On the contrary he
still repeatedly uses expressions which leave no doubt as to his
devotion to the papal chair.3 That devotion receives its first shock
through the condemnation of his nineteen theses in the year 1377. And
even then for a long time he distinguishes between the present pope
and the papacy. Not until the eighties is his breach with the papacy
complete, at the time when his fight “with the sects'' is at its height.
Now in his book De Civili Dominio he says only good things of the
mendicant friars. It is they who most nearly approach his ideal of
Christian clergy; for imitating the walk of Christ and his apostles‚ they
seek to attain to the greatest perfection on earth. He is still far from
adopting the tone of his contemporary Chaucer towards the begging
monks. But if one looks more closely, one sees the first traces os
the cleavage between wychf and the mendicant friam, which however
soon became too wide to be bridged over. In this book we find the
proposition: there should be only one order, the order of Jesus
Christ. Our abbot is Christ, and in the strictest sense he was poor.4

1 Si dominus papa potest committere alicuique ycliote⁷ sine hoc quod ministret
in suo beneficio secundum aliquod officium clericale, potestatem et officium spoliandi
clericos 'non convictos ex inhabilitate officii, quin a maiori potest tradere laico
potestatem et iniungere sibi ministerium auferendi bona ecclesie a quocunque clerico
abutente. . . .

2 Et fidem istius sentencie vellem curn humilitate michi imprimere, cum
dominus papa dedit michi prebendam in ecclesia Lincolniensi et facta sollicitudine
ad colligendum sibi primos fructus quadraginta quinque librarum contulit uni iu-
venir transmarino eandem prebendam per viam reservacionis abdite, non facta in-
quisicione de inhabilitate persone mee nec facta instancia ex parte mea pro huius-
modi dispensacione. But cf. Cal. of Entries in the Papal Registres IV, 193.

3 Ideo absit Romano pontifici imponere hanc avariciam, ut preter questum. . . .

4 Abbas noster fuit summe pauper. And yet in the fourth chapter of the
third book he still calls the order of the Minorites venerable. Exhinc enim vene-
